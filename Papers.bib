	abstract = {A new method devised for solving the three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric refraction problem is presented. It considers the situation when the origin and the end of the refracted beam are given (boundary value problem) and is based on Fermat’s variational principle. Original points of the method are the 3D geometry with ellipsoidal Earth, no sampling of exo-atmospheric beam and treatment of mirage effects.

	 The method is first described and great care is given to the particular case of grazing incidence yielding mirages. In contrast, the case of exo-atmospheric paths (satellite links) is optimized by using a variable integration step, large outside and small inside the atmosphere. Validation is then performed by comparison with numerical and analytical models in the case of astronomical refraction and with MODTRAN 3.5 in the case of terrestrial refraction. The influence of the Earth’s oblateness is shown to modify the refraction angle by 1.3\% in absolute magnitude. Consistency is also checked with the direct method where the origin, direction of sight and distance are specified (initial value problem).

	 In a companion paper (Berton, Part II) the influence of significant parameters such as observer and target distance and altitude, vertical profiles of temperature, pressure and humidity, wavelength and sampling step will be analysed in detail. The accuracy of the refractive index formula will also be tested.}

	abstract = {In a previous paper (Berton 2006 J. Opt. A: Pure Appl. Opt. 8 817–30) we described the variational method devised for solving the 3D atmospheric refraction problem when the origin and the end of the refracted beam are given (boundary value problem). A validation was performed by comparison with numerical and analytical models in the case of astronomical refraction and with MODTRAN in the case of atmospheric refraction. Consistency was also checked with the direct method in which the origin, direction of sight and distance are specified (initial value problem).

 In this second part the method is applied in order to examine the influence of various elements on the positioning of a target in the visible and near-infrared. Ciddor’s formula of the refractive index has been adopted here. When the target is on the ground, the separation distance l  between the apparent and the real targets is also used as a criterion, beside the refraction angle R. The Earth’s oblateness causes a discrepancy of 1\% compared to a spherical Earth, while the various geometric configurations show that R  can be multiplied by five and the ground distance l by 80 when the distance observer–target d  increases from 6 to 45 km. The refraction angle is found to increase quasi-linearly as a function of d, which leads to l  increasing as d2.

 As regards the impact of the vertical profiles of temperature, pressure and humidity, a maximum difference of 40\% is found between the profiles ‘tropical summer’ and ‘sub-arctic winter’. The ‘US standard’ type, which is a climatic average, yields intermediate refractive effects, closer to the ‘tropical summer’ type. The influence of wavelength in the interval 0.5–1.7 µm  leads to a steep decrease of the refraction angle with an amplitude of about 2\%; variations have been modelled with a second-degree polynomial of the wavenumber whose coefficients are little dependent on the configurations examined here. Eventually, the optimal sampling step is that one which produces at least 25 sampling points.},

	abstract = { Photogrammetric refraction computation methods for high oblique aerial photographs are derived from Snell's law for rays in a spherically stratified atmosphere. The methods, based on numerically integrating the refraction integrals, are applicable for zenith angles between 0 and 90 degrees. The atmospheric index of refraction is determined from atmospheric models of pressure and temperature. The models may be adjusted to reflect local pressure and temperature data when available. Standard aircraff pressurization procedures are used to evaluate the pressurized camera compartment refraction. Expressions are derived for the corrections to the image coordinates of photographs with arbitrary obliquity.  The effects of diffrent atmospheric models, geographic location, time of year, and large zenith angles are illustrated in the form of numerical tables and graphs. The results are applicable to determining the ground coordinates of points im- aged with high oblique aerial surveillance cameras. A byproduct of the theory is a unified treatment of atmospheric refraction for arbitrary zenith angles.},

	abstract = {Atmospheric refraction is one of the most significant factors that affect the geolocation accuracy of high-resolution remote sensing images. However, most of the current atmospheric refraction correction methods based on empirical data neglect the spatiotemporal variation of pressure, temperature, and humidity of the atmosphere, inevitably resulting in poor geometric positioning accuracy. Therefore, in terms of the problems mentioned above, this study proposed a spatiotemporal atmospheric refraction correction method (SARCM) based on global measured data to avoid the uncertainty of traditional empirical models. Initially, the atmosphere was stratified into 42 layers according to their pressure property, and each layer was divided into 1,042,560 grid cells with intervals of 0.25 longitude and 0.25 latitude. Then, the atmospheric refractive index of each grid in the imaging region was accurately calculated using the high-precision Ciddor formula, and the result was interpolated using three splines. Subsequently, according to the rigorous geometric positioning model, the line-of-sight of each pixel and the viewing zenith angle outside the atmosphere in WGS84 were derived to provide input for atmospheric refraction correction. Finally, the coordinates of the ground control points were corrected with the calculated atmospheric refractive index and Snell’s law. The experimental results showed that the proposed SARCM could effectively improve the positioning accuracy of the image with a large viewing zenith angle, and especially, the improvement percentage for a viewing zenith angle of 34.2426° in the x-direction was 99.5\%. Moreover, the atmospheric refraction correction result of the SARCM was better than that of the primary state-of-the-art methods.},

We define functions which represent Cartesian coordinates and take the arc length as the independent variable. Then the ray equation can be transformed to convenient pattern by these defined functions. This proposed method avoids the complex transformation and interpolation in traditional techniques. So the coordinate value can be directly solved using the computational software. The solution procedure has been demonstrated by a ray tracing simulation in an axial gradient refractive-index media. And the computer code can be developed. Comparing with the analytical solution shows that the error of the proposed method is small.}

Our derivation utilises Snell’s law and models the apparent uplift of a terrain point due refraction along the path from the ground object to the image. We show the approximate equivalence with older results in the literature, especially for aerial mapping ﬂight heights under 7 km.},

	abstract = {Multimodal image matching, which refers to identifying and then corresponding the same or similar structure/content from two or more images that are of significant modalities or nonlinear appearance difference, is a fundamental and critical problem in a wide range of applications, including medical, remote sensing and computer vision. An increasing number and diversity of methods have been proposed over the past decades, particularly in this deep learning era, due to the challenges in eliminating modality variance and geometrical deformation that intrinsically exist in multimodal image matching. However, a comprehensive review and analysis of traditional and recent trainable methods and their applications in different research fields are lacking. To this end and in this survey, we first introduce two general frameworks, saying area- and feature-based, in terms of their core components, taxonomy, and procedure details. Second, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal image matching methods from handcrafted to deep methods for each research field according to their imaging nature, including medical, remote sensing and computer vision. Extensive experimental comparisons of interest point detection, description and matching, and image registration are performed on various datasets containing common types of multimodal image pairs that we collected and annotated. Finally, we briefly introduce and analyze several typical applications to reveal the significance of multimodal image matching and provide insightful discussions and conclusions to these multimodal image matching approaches, and simultaneously deliver their future trends for researchers and engineers in related research areas to achieve further breakthroughs.},
